  <comment>Made for easy replication of a mongodb to other sources, this oplog reader will read from multiple mongo logs at one time and put the data in a single concurrent queue.  This is made in case you have multiple mongo masters to listen for events. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
